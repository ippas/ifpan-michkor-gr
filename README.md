# GRTraits : Database of GR regulated genes

#### Project logline (technique, organism, tissue type)

Identification of GR-dependent genes

## Methods

This sections should be a description of preprocessin and analysis ready to be included in the publication

## Preprocessing

Details of file preprocessing

## Analysis

Details of analysis

_notes: all files included in the repo need to be referenced, either in README or other .md files. The analysis has to be fully reproducible, in principle the repo should contain code + description of how to run it while data and results kept outside_

## About this template

Directories:

- _root_ - README.md, \*.Rproj, general configuration files, etc.
- raw - raw data
- preprocessing - scripts
- data - useful data, created by scripts/tools/preprocessing
- analysis - analysis source code
- results - output ready to present
